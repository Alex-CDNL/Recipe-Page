        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <ul>
            <strong>Beat the eggs</strong
            >: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until
            they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a
            fluffier texture.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <strong>Heat the pan</strong
            >: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or
            oil.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <strong>Cook the omelette</strong
            >: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt
            the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <strong>Add fillings (optional)</strong
            >: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly
            runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of
            the omelette.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <strong>Fold and serve</strong
            >: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and
            fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then
            slide it onto a plate.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <strong>Enjoy</strong
            >: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
          </ul>
        </ol>
